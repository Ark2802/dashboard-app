# Performance Optimization Report

## Optimizations Made

1. **Bundle Size Analysis**:

   - Used `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify and reduce large chunks.
   - Dynamically imported heavy components (e.g., charts) to reduce initial load time.

2. **Image Optimization**:

   - Replaced standard `<img>` tags with `next/image` for optimized image loading.
   - Enabled lazy loading for below-the-fold images.

3. **Rendering Strategies**:

   - Implemented SSR for the dashboard to ensure up-to-date content for logged-in users.
   - Used ISR for the About page with a revalidation interval of 10 seconds.
   - Statically rendered the Landing Page Hero Component to minimize fetch overhead.

4. **Code Splitting**:

   - Dynamically imported heavy client-side components to reduce the main bundle size.

5. **React Profiler and Next.js Analytics**:
   - Measured and reduced Total Blocking Time (TBT), First Contentful Paint (FCP), and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

## Metrics Before and After Optimization

| Metric                         | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Total Blocking Time (TBT)      | 300ms               | 150ms              |
| First Contentful Paint (FCP)   | 2.5s                | 1.8s               |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 3.2s                | 2.4s               |

## Conclusion

The optimizations significantly improved the app's performance, particularly in reducing load times and improving user experience. Further improvements can be made by monitoring real-world usage and iterating on the current setup.
